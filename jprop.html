			<h2>Welcome</h2>
				<p>
					If you're looking for high-quality, hand-crafted juggling and circus
					products, the J-Prop Shop is the store for you. I've designed and
					built props for the past 35 years, and my products have been used by
					professional entertainers and hobbyists throughout the world. Our
					prices are reasonable and our quality is excellent.

			<h2>Specials This Month</h2>
				<p>
					The following devil sticks are available at a special discount for
					the entire month of May:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Basic Stick ($19.95)</strong>
							The easiest stick to learn with, but "grippy" enough for the most
							demanding tricks. Comes in red, green & blue.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Flower Stick ($24.95)</strong>
							A graceful stick with colored tassles. Flower Sticks float slowly,
							making them ideal for beginners.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Master Stick ($39.95)</strong>
							Our most popular stick is shorter & heavier for fast play & more
							advanced tricks. Each Master Stick is available in custom colors.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Glow Stick ($29.95)</strong>
							The Glow Stick shines brightly at night (without the danger of a fire stick).
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Quality Tested</h2>
				<p>
					Every item I create is checked and tested before being shipped out to
					assure perfect quality. I take pride in every one of my juggling props
					and I want my customers to feel the same pride!
